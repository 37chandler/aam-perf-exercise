## AAM Performance Exericse

This repo is for an in-class exercise (i.e., not an assignment) that we'll do during the week where we cover yardstick and measures of model accuracy. Nothing in here is too complicated, but I'd like to provide the code just to jump-start your work.

Your first exercise will be assessing five different predictive models for Subary price. The second accuracy will be assessing four different classification models that are attempting to predict a segment.
